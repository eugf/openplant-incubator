# OpenPlant Incubator

The code in this repository is open sourced and provides tools to develop a plant incubator with cloud-based monitoring services. At Genspace, we run this code to log regular measurements of plants being grown in our incubator after which information is made available for further analysis via direct query of a Postgres database running on an EC2 server as well as a cache of processed images of our samples that are binned in s3. We hope this repository can be used as a model to inspire similar work among other research teams.
