# OpenPlant Incubator

This project is to support the creation of an inexpensive plant incubator for the growth of liveworts (_Marchantia polymorpha_) which is the model system used by the [OpenPlant][1] collaboration. Our hope is that this design will allow a diverse array of (citizen) scientists cultivate plants under controlled conditions and potentially contribute to basic research.

## Incubator design

This design attempts to replicate the ideal conditions identified by Vujičić ([et al. 2010][2]) and reported by Chiyoda ([et al. 2008][3]). These conditions can be summarized as:

* 22°C
* 50-60 μmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>s (which for cool white fluorescent light equals 3700-4440 lux \[[Thimijan and Heins 1983][4]\])
* 16 h light, 8 h dark cycle

Furthermore we would like this project to be a relatively simple build so in general we are using well documented components from [Adafruit][5]. However the use of a wide array of purchased or scavenged parts is encouraged. We will describe the parts and their interaction with code in the "Description of parts" section, so jump there if you're trying to make a substitution(s).
